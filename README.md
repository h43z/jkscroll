Shortcuts for your [browser](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/jk-scroll/) by [@h43z](https://twitter.com/h43z). 

Too many browser extensions have permissions that allow them full
access to every website you are visiting. 

This extension does 90% of what I want from a shortcut extension in just 22
lines of understandable code.

Extend it if you need more functionality.

Shortcut list
```
// content-script.js
j => scroll down
k => scroll up
h => go back one page in history
l => go forward one page in history

// background-script.js 
// this functionality needs the browser extension API.
// Only so called background scripts have access to it.
w => close tab
t => reopen last closed tab
```

Run `sh create-extension.sh` and install `jk-extension.zip` manually in your
browsers addons/extension section.

So far the commands in  `background-script` won't work in `google-chrome`.
Replace the `browser` keyword with `chrome` and change the code from using
`promises` into callbacks. That should do the trick.
